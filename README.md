# CS551_project

Creating a new dataset requires the presence of a large amount of skilled manpower, time and money. Gener-
ative Adversarial Network (GAN) can help mitigate this problem as it can be used to generate new data from

random noise and given small dataset. In this project, we shall use GAN to generate a dataset of images of fun-
dus manifesting various diseases. The dataset thus generated will be immensely useful to classify the diseases

present in fundus at a later stage.
